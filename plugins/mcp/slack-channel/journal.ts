/**
 * journal.ts — Tamper-evident audit journal for the Slack↔Claude-Code bridge.
 *
 * This file is the Epic 30-A entry point. Scope of this bead (ccsc-5pi.1)
 * is narrow: the `JournalEvent` schema and its inferred type. The writer,
 * redaction module, canonical-JSON serializer, and verification command
 * land in sibling beads (ccsc-5pi.2 – ccsc-5pi.16). See
 * 000-docs/audit-journal-architecture.md for the full contract.
 *
 * Shape of a journal event (audit-journal-architecture.md §19-59):
 *
 *   {
 *     v:        1,                          // schema version; chain refuses mixed versions
 *     ts:       '2026-04-19T12:34:56.789Z', // ISO-8601 UTC with ms precision
 *     seq:      42,                         // monotonic per chain
 *     kind:     'gate.inbound.drop',        // discriminated union of 22 event kinds
 *     toolName?: 'reply',
 *     input?:   { chat_id: 'C01', text: '...' },     // post-redaction
 *     outcome?: 'allow' | 'deny' | 'require' | 'drop' | 'n/a',
 *     reason?:  'peer bot not in allowFrom',
 *     ruleId?:  'no-exfil-to-untrusted-channel',
 *     sessionKey?: { channel: 'C01', thread: '1711000000.000100' },
 *     actor?:   'session_owner' | 'claude_process' | ...,
 *     correlationId?: 'req-abc123',
 *     prevHash: 'e3b0c44...',                // sha256 hex, 64 chars
 *     hash:     'b94d27b...',                // sha256 hex, 64 chars
 *   }
 *
 * Why `strict()` on the schema: the chain property depends on every writer
 * and every verifier hashing the **same bytes**. Accepting unknown fields
 * would let callers sneak unredacted content through the writer's redactor
 * (which only walks the documented fields). Strict mode surfaces those
 * mistakes at build time or on the first `parse()` call.

 *    - Strict `JournalEvent` shape (v1 OR v2).
 *    - Version transition: v1 → v2 is permitted contiguously; v2 → v1
 *      after a v2 event has been accepted is a tamper signal (rollback
 *      attack). ccsc-22l adds this gate.
 *    - `hash` matches the recomputed value bit-for-bit. The recompute
 *      strips BOTH `hash` and `signature` so the v2 hash covers the
 *      same canonical bytes the signature signs.
 *    - On v2 events: `signature` (when present) verifies under the
 *      currently-active public key. `system.key_rotation` events
 *      verify under the OLD key, then switch the key for subsequent
 *      events.
 *    - `prevHash` matches the previous accepted event's `hash`
 *      (first event's `prevHash` is trusted as the genesis value —
 *      that's the `TRUSTED_ANCHOR` contract from §76-85; validating
 *      the anchor is a caller concern for now).
 *    - `seq` is strictly monotonic by +1 with no gaps.
